You may know that traditionally this tasks sequence is used to &amp;lsquo;build&amp;rsquo; devices and have them ready to start the autopilot process. I had a customer recently that had that very need. They had purchased a large number of machines that were delivered with Windows 10 installed and not Windows 11. As the customer was on their Windows 11 uplift journey already they were a bit disappointed to say the least and they opted to create a Configuration Manager task sequence to prep them for autopilot.</description></item><item><title>INTUNE AND POWERBI DEEP DIVE - PART 6 - GET-DEVICES</title><link>https://deploymentshare.com/post/bp-6-pbi-intune/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Nov 2023 19:30:45 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://deploymentshare.com/post/bp-6-pbi-intune/</guid><description>In this post we are finally going to get some data into PowerBI to play around with. We are going to look at forming a query in PowerBI, then to use it to go and retrieve our devices and their information. Remember discussing pagination for APIs? Well&amp;hellip; should you have more than 1000 devices we&amp;rsquo;re also going to need to consider Pagination.
Now, you might consider employing a coding mindset akin to PowerShell, such as fetching the initial 1000 devices and implementing a do-while loop to retrieve the remaining ones using a method such as checking for the presence of another @Data.</description></item><item><title>INTUNE AND POWERBI DEEP DIVE - PART 5 - LOGIC APP</title><link>https://deploymentshare.com/post/bp-5-pbi-intune/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Nov 2023 19:30:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://deploymentshare.com/post/bp-5-pbi-intune/</guid><description>In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at using logic apps to do the &amp;lsquo;heavy lifting&amp;rsquo; for us. By heavy lifting, I mean taking our bearer token for authentication to the tenant, using the app registration permissions for authorisation to the data, then processing the result from the Microsoft Graph API call (pagination) in order to make sure we have all the data we need then finally passing the results back to PowerBI, so we can make a nice dashboard out of the results.
Logic App Design / Build So, lets take a look at the Logic App used in the calls we might make in the upcoming sections</description></item><item><title>Intune and PowerBI Deep Dive - Part 4 - Get-BearerToken</title><link>https://deploymentshare.com/post/bp-4-pbi-intune/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jul 2023 21:54:45 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://deploymentshare.com/post/bp-4-pbi-intune/</guid><description>The reason I&amp;rsquo;ve called this post &amp;lsquo;Get-BearerToken&amp;rsquo; is because I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain how to use a combination of PowerBI Variables and a function to leverage the Application Registration we have to get a bearer token within PowerBI Desktop. We can then use that bearer token to authenticate against the Microsoft Graph and start to pull data into PowerBI. If you didn&amp;rsquo;t know, a Graph response will provide a maximum of 1000 replies and the rest of the replies will be split into chunks, known as pages. So page 1 contains responses 1-1000, page 2 1001-2000 and so on and so forth.</description></item><item><title>Intune and PowerBI Deep Dive - Part 3 - Exploring Graph URLs</title><link>https://deploymentshare.com/post/bp-3-pbi-intune/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jul 2023 20:10:45 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://deploymentshare.com/post/bp-3-pbi-intune/</guid><description>Next up, we&amp;rsquo;re going to explore the Graph and the URLs and permissions, in this post, continuing on from Part 1 and Part 2 , our next step is begin to firstly understand our path to getting Intune Data into PowerBi, which is going to be via direct Microsoft Graph calls - Remembering of course that the Intune Data warehouse did not meet our requirements. We are also going to leverage an application registration to access the data we want to see. This is gonna be a BIG post, so make sure you have plenty of time to read.
Quick Links We&amp;rsquo;re going to explore the Microsoft Graph URLs, the structure of them, how to obtain what we need and some tools to test them to ensure we&amp;rsquo;ve got them correct.</description></item><item><title>Intune and PowerBI Deep Dive - Part 2 - Application Registration</title><link>https://deploymentshare.com/post/bp-2-pbi-intune/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jun 2023 11:41:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://deploymentshare.com/post/bp-2-pbi-intune/</guid><description>Continuing from Part 1 , our next step is to establish an application registration in Azure. This registration will enable us to utilize its capabilities for accessing data on the Microsoft Graph and seamlessly importing that data into PowerBI. This setup is essential as it serves as a prerequisite for accomplishing our ultimate objective.
Quick Links Creating the App Reg This is going to be a &amp;lsquo;whistle stop tour&amp;rsquo; of setting up an application registration. Consider this a condensed guide that will provide you with the necessary steps. As you progress and develop your PowerBI data sets, you can always revisit specific parts of this process to add additional permissions, granting you access to more data.</description></item><item><title>Intune and PowerBI Deep Dive - Part 1 - Where to Start</title><link>https://deploymentshare.com/post/bp-1-pbi-intune/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jun 2023 20:10:45 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://deploymentshare.com/post/bp-1-pbi-intune/</guid><description>In this series, I will guide you through the process of extracting data from Microsoft Graph, specifically Microsoft Intune, and integrating it into PowerBI. We will explore different approaches, considering their advantages and disadvantages, in order to provide you with a solid foundation for creating your own reports within your specific environment.

I’ve been thinking about writing this for a while and I hope it helps some of you new to app packaging.
How do I build apps? It never hurts to brush up if you’re a seasoned app-packager. App packaging isn’t going away any time soon, everyone needs apps. The Microsoft app store has gotten better but I don’t feel it’s quite there yet in terms of broadly available applications. Sometimes, companies can have line-of-business applications that they build in-house and as system administrators, you may be responsible for packaging and distributing those applications.</description></item><item><title>Logon to Autopilot HAADJ Devices Using FortiClient VPN</title><link>https://deploymentshare.com/post/bp-forticlient/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://deploymentshare.com/post/bp-forticlient/</guid><description>I recently had a customer who uses FortiClient as their VPN solution, and they have recently embarked on setting up Hybrid AAD. We set their tenant up, sorted out licensing and I started to put in the fundamental elements to begin the journey to using Autopilot for provisioning devices. I had undertaken setting up AAD connect and using IDFix to remediate any issues, such as UPN suffixes for end-users via PowerShell, and we were ready to go. Equally, I had made them an Intune Win32app for FortiClient, and this installed and removed just fine using PSADT. I had already tested the Autopilot process and things were looking good.</description></item><item><title>PowerShell App Deployment Toolkit and Intune Win32 APPS</title><link>https://deploymentshare.com/post/bp-psadtintune/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://deploymentshare.com/post/bp-psadtintune/</guid><description>Hi Folks! Leading on from this post about getting started with PSADT, and as promised, I’m writing up my experience with it and creating Win32 Intune apps. So firstly, I’m assuming by now that you read and absorbed the first write up I did, you should have noticed that a couple of things I did in that post can actually be done differently and be eager and armed with understanding the format and have a good idea about what to do. Combine that with great ‘google-fu’ and you’re ready to continue your decent app packaging journey. Using this with ConfigMgr applications is quite simple because once you’ve prepared your application you use the root folder as the source content for the application and the rest is pretty straight forward (holler at me if you want that blogging too).</description></item><item><title>PowerShell App Deployment Toolkit Write Up</title><link>https://deploymentshare.com/post/bp-psadt/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://deploymentshare.com/post/bp-psadt/</guid><description>Hi all, thought I’d write up what I’ve been working on recently, which is re-visiting PowerShell App Deployment Toolkit. A great Resource for ConfigMgr apps, but equally it is supported in Intune so I will be doing a follow-up post on using this with Intune. I know there are plenty of blogs out there on this so this is just my interpretation and is intended to get people started. I know, for example, that the kit comes with a wide variety cmdlets that you can utilise to achieve tasks but this write up is based around getting those a little familiar with PowerShell up to speed with it.</description></item><item><title>Elements That You Can Use To Create A New Post On This Template.</title><link>https://deploymentshare.com/post/elements/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Mar 2020 15:40:24 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://deploymentshare.com/post/elements/</guid><description>Heading example Here is example of hedings.

When an issue arises where I can’t connect to another system the question is asked “Do you have these ports open from A to B?” , often my contact is unsure as larger organisations generally have segregated IT functions and the network engineers are on a different team. Remembering all of the ports required from the different System Center 2012 R2 roles is also something you may have to refer to notes or TechNet for.</description></item></channel></rss>
