      <description>Dearest gentle reader&amp;hellip; (Yes, my wife is making me watch that Bridgerton series on netflix, so I may speak like a 19th century gentlemen during this blog post&amp;hellip; or not&amp;hellip;) I recently wrote about Center for Information Security (CIS) and how those configurations broke Windows Autopilot. It then developed into a series on CIS with another gentleman of the manor, Nick Benton. And so, speaking of security posture, on my latest customer engagement they wanted to modernise their Windows Management and explore Entra joined only devices using Autopilot, but also, to improve their security configuration by using Microsoft Security Baselines - which of course I did but in doing so this broke their SAML authentication on Forticlient VPN - so here&amp;rsquo;s the story of how I fixed it.</description>

      <description>I recently had a customer who uses FortiClient as their VPN solution, and they have recently embarked on setting up Hybrid AAD. We set their tenant up, sorted out licensing and I started to put in the fundamental elements to begin the journey to using Autopilot for provisioning devices. I had undertaken setting up AAD connect and using IDFix to remediate any issues, such as UPN suffixes for end-users via PowerShell, and we were ready to go. Equally, I had made them an Intune Win32app for FortiClient, and this installed and removed just fine using PSADT. I had already tested the Autopilot process and things were looking good.</description>
