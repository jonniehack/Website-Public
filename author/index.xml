I am currently working as a Technical Consultant in the Cloud Endpoint practice at Phoenix Software (who, in recognition for outstanding achievements, have been awarded Microsoft Partner of the Year for 2023 ), specialising in the deployment and management of Microsoft Intune, a pivotal tool for modern device management and application deployment.
Beyond working with Microsoft Intune, I am passionate about PowerShell scripting and PowerBI reporting. This interest extends beyond professional obligation, reflecting a genuine enthusiasm for the products and trying to apply them to everyday life. Whether supporting clients on their cloud journey, crafting PowerShell scripts to automate complex tasks day-to-day or harnessing PowerBI for insightful data reporting, I&amp;rsquo;m normally geeking out somewhere.</description></item></channel></rss>
