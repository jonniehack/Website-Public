      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/autopilot/tutorial/existing-devices/deploy-autopilot-task-sequence&#34;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&gt;Windows autopilot deployment for existing devices Task sequence&lt;/a&gt; in configuration manager and modifying that task sequence to set a &lt;a href=&#34;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/autopilot/enrollment-autopilot&#34;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&gt;group tag&lt;/a&gt; during the process.  You may know that traditionally this tasks sequence is used to &amp;lsquo;build&amp;rsquo; devices and have them ready to start the autopilot process.  I had a customer recently that had that very need.  They had purchased a large number of machines that were delivered with Windows 10 installed and not Windows 11.  As the customer was on their Windows 11 uplift journey already they were a bit disappointed to say the least and they opted to create a Configuration Manager task sequence to prep them for autopilot.  That prep process was to include wiping the device and re-loading with Windows 11, adding the device to the tenants autopilot devices AND setting a group tag to drop the device into pre-created groups that control the apps and configurations the devices are going to receive during autopilot.&#xA;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PowerShell App Deployment Toolkit Write Up</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi all, thought I’d write up what I’ve been working on recently, which is re-visiting PowerShell App Deployment Toolkit.  A great Resource for ConfigMgr apps, but equally it is supported in Intune so I will be doing a follow-up post on using this with Intune.  I know there are plenty of blogs out there on this so this is just my interpretation and is intended to get people started.&#xA;I know, for example, that the kit comes with a wide variety cmdlets that you can utilise to achieve tasks but this write up is based around getting those a little familiar with PowerShell up to speed with it.  There are many ways to skin a cat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
