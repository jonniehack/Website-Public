You may know that traditionally this tasks sequence is used to &amp;lsquo;build&amp;rsquo; devices and have them ready to start the autopilot process. I had a customer recently that had that very need. They had purchased a large number of machines that were delivered with Windows 10 installed and not Windows 11. As the customer was on their Windows 11 uplift journey already they were a bit disappointed to say the least and they opted to create a Configuration Manager task sequence to prep them for autopilot.</description></item><item><title>PowerShell App Deployment Toolkit Write Up</title><link>https://deploymentshare.com/post/BP-PSADT/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://deploymentshare.com/post/BP-PSADT/</guid><description>Hi all, thought I’d write up what I’ve been working on recently, which is re-visiting PowerShell App Deployment Toolkit. A great Resource for ConfigMgr apps, but equally it is supported in Intune so I will be doing a follow-up post on using this with Intune. I know there are plenty of blogs out there on this so this is just my interpretation and is intended to get people started. I know, for example, that the kit comes with a wide variety cmdlets that you can utilise to achieve tasks but this write up is based around getting those a little familiar with PowerShell up to speed with it.</description></item><item><title>System Center 2012 Port Checking Tool</title><link>https://deploymentshare.com/post/BP-PortCheckingTool/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2016 20:10:45 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://deploymentshare.com/post/BP-PortCheckingTool/</guid><description>As a consultant a lot of my time is spent working on infrastructures where I am working within tight timescales and I don’t have a great deal of insight into the configuration of their network. When an issue arises where I can’t connect to another system the question is asked “Do you have these ports open from A to B?” , often my contact is unsure as larger organisations generally have segregated IT functions and the network engineers are on a different team. Remembering all of the ports required from the different System Center 2012 R2 roles is also something you may have to refer to notes or TechNet for.</description></item></channel></rss>
