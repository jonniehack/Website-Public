      <description>Hi Folks! Leading on from this post about getting started with PSADT, and as promised, I’m writing up my experience with it and creating Win32 Intune apps. So firstly, I’m assuming by now that you read and absorbed the first write up I did, you should have noticed that a couple of things I did in that post can actually be done differently and be eager and armed with understanding the format and have a good idea about what to do. Combine that with great ‘google-fu’ and you’re ready to continue your decent app packaging journey. Using this with ConfigMgr applications is quite simple because once you’ve prepared your application you use the root folder as the source content for the application and the rest is pretty straight forward (holler at me if you want that blogging too).</description>
