      <description>Dearest gentle reader&amp;hellip; (Yes, my wife is making me watch that Bridgerton series on netflix, so I may speak like a 19th century gentlemen during this blog post&amp;hellip; or not&amp;hellip;) I recently wrote about Center for Information Security (CIS) and how those configurations broke Windows Autopilot. It then developed into a series on CIS with another gentleman of the manor, Nick Benton. And so, speaking of security posture, on my latest customer engagement they wanted to modernise their Windows Management and explore Entra joined only devices using Autopilot, but also, to improve their security configuration by using Microsoft Security Baselines - which of course I did but in doing so this broke their SAML authentication on Forticlient VPN - so here&amp;rsquo;s the story of how I fixed it.</description>

      <title>Setting a Group Tag During a Configuration Manager Task Sequence</title>

      <description>In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about using the Windows autopilot deployment for existing devices Task sequence in configuration manager and modifying that task sequence to set a group tag during the process. You may know that traditionally this tasks sequence is used to &amp;lsquo;build&amp;rsquo; devices and have them ready to start the autopilot process. I had a customer recently that had that very need. They had purchased a large number of machines that were delivered with Windows 10 installed and not Windows 11. As the customer was on their Windows 11 uplift journey already they were a bit disappointed to say the least and they opted to create a Configuration Manager task sequence to prep them for autopilot.</description>

      <title>Logon to Autopilot HAADJ Devices Using FortiClient VPN</title>

      <description>I recently had a customer who uses FortiClient as their VPN solution, and they have recently embarked on setting up Hybrid AAD. We set their tenant up, sorted out licensing and I started to put in the fundamental elements to begin the journey to using Autopilot for provisioning devices. I had undertaken setting up AAD connect and using IDFix to remediate any issues, such as UPN suffixes for end-users via PowerShell, and we were ready to go. Equally, I had made them an Intune Win32app for FortiClient, and this installed and removed just fine using PSADT. I had already tested the Autopilot process and things were looking good.</description>
