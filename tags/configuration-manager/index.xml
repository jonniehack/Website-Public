      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are you ready for Windows 11?  No?  Why not?  Windows 10 deadline is fast approaching - just look at the title image its already starting to fade away&amp;hellip; I kid you not October will be here quick as a flash and there&amp;rsquo;s much to do.  Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve had a couple of Configuration Manager customers, starting their journey to Windows 11 and as a result I thought I&amp;rsquo;d create this short blog post on some useful Configuration Manager collections I&amp;rsquo;ve used to aid my customers on their journey.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A well-structured deployment strategy is crucial for a smooth rollout, and some customers still use Microsoft Configuration Manager (SCCM/MEMCM) which plays a strong role in certain upgrade plans. As with dynamic membership rules in Intune, one of the most powerful tools within Configuration Manager is its ability to create dynamic device collections from a massive plethora of conditions, allowing IT teams to segment and control deployments with more precision.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Setting a Group Tag During a Configuration Manager Task Sequence</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/autopilot/tutorial/existing-devices/deploy-autopilot-task-sequence&#34;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&gt;Windows autopilot deployment for existing devices Task sequence&lt;/a&gt; in configuration manager and modifying that task sequence to set a &lt;a href=&#34;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/autopilot/enrollment-autopilot&#34;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&gt;group tag&lt;/a&gt; during the process.  You may know that traditionally this tasks sequence is used to &amp;lsquo;build&amp;rsquo; devices and have them ready to start the autopilot process.  I had a customer recently that had that very need.  They had purchased a large number of machines that were delivered with Windows 10 installed and not Windows 11.  As the customer was on their Windows 11 uplift journey already they were a bit disappointed to say the least and they opted to create a Configuration Manager task sequence to prep them for autopilot.  That prep process was to include wiping the device and re-loading with Windows 11, adding the device to the tenants autopilot devices AND setting a group tag to drop the device into pre-created groups that control the apps and configurations the devices are going to receive during autopilot.&#xA;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
