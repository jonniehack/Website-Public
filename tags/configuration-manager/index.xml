      <description>Are you ready for Windows 11? No? Why not? Windows 10 deadline is fast approaching - just look at the title image its already starting to fade away&amp;hellip; I kid you not October will be here quick as a flash and there&amp;rsquo;s much to do. Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve had a couple of Configuration Manager customers, starting their journey to Windows 11 and as a result I thought I&amp;rsquo;d create this short blog post on some useful Configuration Manager collections I&amp;rsquo;ve used to aid my customers on their journey.&#xA;A well-structured deployment strategy is crucial for a smooth rollout, and some customers still use Microsoft Configuration Manager (SCCM/MEMCM) which plays a strong role in certain upgrade plans.</description>

      <description>In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about using the Windows autopilot deployment for existing devices Task sequence in configuration manager and modifying that task sequence to set a group tag during the process. You may know that traditionally this tasks sequence is used to &amp;lsquo;build&amp;rsquo; devices and have them ready to start the autopilot process. I had a customer recently that had that very need. They had purchased a large number of machines that were delivered with Windows 10 installed and not Windows 11. As the customer was on their Windows 11 uplift journey already they were a bit disappointed to say the least and they opted to create a Configuration Manager task sequence to prep them for autopilot.</description>
